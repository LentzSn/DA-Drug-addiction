# Data analysis
This is holding my data analysis project on Drug addiction. A project that was completed in school. Here's the description :

"This database comes from a study conducted as part of a drug abuse treatment.
The objective of the study was to compare two treatment programs and different durations to reduce drug abuse and prevent HIV risk behaviors.
The sites of the two treatment programs are designated A and B. The site A program included 400 subjects who received either 3 months or 6 months of community-based treatment. In the site B treatment program, 175 subjects were included to receive either 6 months or 12 months of community-based treatment involving very strict communal living rules "

Some analyses were run (descriptive statistics, t-test, anova, correlations) in order to draw some conclusions
